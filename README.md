# Your Life
This project is something I have been wanting to do for a long time. Since I came through "Your  Life in Weeks" by Tim Urban (because of a college assignment), I have been fascinated by the idea of portraying the big picture of one's life.

I like really liked the idea of visualizing our life in weeks, months or even years and to meditate on the decisions we make. Some of these decisions are small but can have huge impact in our lives.

This project is a simple web app that gives insights about life using data and interesting visualizations.

IMPORTANT: I do not intend to claim any work inspired by Tim Urban as mine. All credits go to him for the original idea.
